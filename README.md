# Python-for-Data-Analysis

For OnPoint Insights, I have developed Jupyter notebooks on Introduction to Python and multiple libraries of Python like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Sklearn.
We used to conduct online webinars on Python programming to help business people understand Python.

**1. Introduction to Python**

In the introduction notebook, I have covered topics like 
- Strings (Sorting, Partinioning)
- Variables
- Operators (Numerical, Logical, Boolean, Comparison, Membership)
- Analysis Functions (Min, Max, Sum, Avg)
- Data Structures (List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionary)
- Conditional Statements (If-elif-else)
- Loops in Python (For and While)
- Statements like Break, Continue, Pass
- Functions (Regular Function, Lambda Functions)


**2. Linear Regression using Sklearn**

For explaining different functions of sklearn, I have used the Boston House data in Python and have build a **Linear Regression** model to predict the price of houses based on the different factors related to houses like Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, Area, etc. I have build scatterplots to plot the predicted and actual values and evaluated the model using mean square errors.


**3. NumPy Library**

In this notebook, I have covered most of the topics in the NumPy library of Python. The topics which I covered are:

- Creating arrays using NumPy
- Developing matrix of random numbers
- Learning about data types in numpy
- Attributes in arrays
- One and multidimensional arrays
- Reshaping, concatenation and splitting arrays
- Arithmetic and Trigonometric functions on arrays
- Broadcasting
- Indexing


**4. Data Manipulation and Analysis using Pandas**

In this notebook, I explained the concepts of Pandas library which are used to manipulate and clean data sets. I build an own data set and explained concepts like data indexing, slicing, deleting rows and columns, and different operations which are performed on data. I explained multiple ways to handle missing data using Pandas. I also covered topics like merging, combining and joining datasets. Other important topics which were covered are Grouping data, performing aggregation functions on data, and pivot tables.
