# Python-for-Data-Analysis

For OnPoint Insights, I have developed Jupyter notebooks on Introduction to Python and multiple libraries of Python like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Sklearn.
We used to conduct online webinars on Python programming to help business people understand Python.

**1. Introduction to Python**

In the introduction notebook, I have covered topics like 
- Strings (Sorting, Partinioning)
- Variables
- Operators (Numerical, Logical, Boolean, Comparison, Membership)
- Analysis Functions (Min, Max, Sum, Avg)
- Data Structures (List, Tuples, Sets, Dictionary)
- Conditional Statements (If-elif-else)
- Loops in Python (For and While)
- Statements like Break, Continue, Pass
- Functions (Regular Function, Lambda Functions)
